- 👋 Hi, I’m Mathilde.
- 🫀 I love funky & groovy music, and to travel as much as I can
- 👀 I’m interested in webdesign, front-end development, Accessibility and Open-Source Projects
- 🌱 I have experience in full-stack, especially front-end development (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and UI-UX Design, Ruby and Ruby on Rails, Javascript, SQL, RESTful APIs...)
- 👨‍🎤 Also, I am an Audiovisual & Digital Archivist and work a lot with music collections. 
<!-----
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Open-Source Projects, Artsy stuff and would love to keep learning about Web Accessibility
